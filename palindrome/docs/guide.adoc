= The Palindrome Challenge with a twist.
A palindrome is a string that is read the same forwards as it is backwards, for example "mom" or "eye". 

Please create a program that completes the following:

* Find the palindromes between 1 and 1 million that are also palindromes in its binary form. E.g 585~10~ = 1001001001~2~  and print 
how many of those were found
* Print the number of cycles needed to find the answer. A cycle is as defined as every time you execute the same line of code 
within a routine of your program.  This is referred as Big O Notation.
* Explain what is the computational complexity of your algorithm.
* Create a REST api where you expose a method to find the palindromes between x and y being the parameters and that returns 
the answer to the 3 above items in JSON format.
